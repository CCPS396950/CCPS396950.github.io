    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards graduating highschool with a scholarship to a university, I have always had this path in mind and my whole school career has been catered to that goal, such as getting good grades, and no detentions. I am working towards these goals in many ways, I am learning about the desirable college traits and skills that are good things that can help me get into a good school. I am keeping my grades up, as well as staying out of any trouble in my years of schooling. Some values I consider necessary for my success are to be hard working, as well as devoted to the task at hand that you are working on. These values can lead to success in your goals. Some Short term goals I hope to accomplish in the near future is to pass the HTML and CSS exam for my Digital Information Technology Class, as well as all other end of the year exams for each period. Some traits I want to be known for is Intellectual, creative, and disciplined, which all shows I have a good character that is well suited for reaching my goals in the future.</p>
